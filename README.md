# East_labeller
A GUI tool for annotating as well as visualizing annotated data for EAST Model

Work in progress. Visualizer done. Annotator work on progress.  You can still use this tool to check if whatver you have tagged/annotated for training an East model can be verified with the tool. 

The image and the corresponding label files should be in the same folders for now. Also, this is still in initial stages of development and so I have not made use of arguments and the sort.
